Hi, my name is Ellis Osborn. I have a BS in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. I have a Top-Secret Security clearence and a CI Polygraph.

I'm most passionate about Web Development (specifically backend) and Databases, but I love learning new things!

I have used languages: Python, Javascript, Java, SQL, as well as some HTML and CSS.

I have experience in frameworks: NodeJS, ReactJS, Vue.js, and Flask.

(11/16) I'm currently working on a Token-Based Authority System project. The backend will be built using Flask as the frameowork, Python, and SQLite3 to handle user data. The frontend is built using Vue.js as the framework, Javascript, and HTML.
