Hi, my name is Ellis Osborn. I have a BS in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. I have a Top-Secret Security clearence and a CI Polygraph.

I'm most passionate about Web Development (backend and fullstack) and Databases, but I love learning new things!

I have used languages: Python, Javascript, Java, SQL, as well as HTML and CSS.

I have experience in frameworks: NodeJS, ReactJS, Next.js, Vue.js, and Flask.

I'm currently working on a fullstack project that will be similar in concept to Facebook marketplace to help me learn Typescript, Next.js, Tailwindcss, and PostgreSQL to add to my arsenal!
