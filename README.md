Hi, my name is Ellis Osborn. I have a BS in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. I have a Top-Secret Security clearence and a CI Polygraph.

I'm most passionate about Web Development (specifically backend) and Databases, but I love learning new things!

I have used languages: Python, Javascript, Java, SQL, as well as some HTML and CSS.

I have experience in frameworks: NodeJS, ReactJS, AngularJS, Django, Express, and Flask.

I'm currently working on a Token-Based Authority System project. It will be using Flask and Python for the backend, AngularJS and Javascript, and SQLite3 to handle user data.
